# Food Review Generator
 
 ## Purpose
 This is a small web program I made to learn the basics of web development and github.
 
 ## What does it do?
 It just takes random food item and generates opinion about it randomly from the array.
 
 ## Influences
 I was inspired by Steve1989MREInfo because he has a great way to rate food
